% Syntax
%   NXC_MotorControl(Port, Power, TachoLimit, SpeedRegulation, ActionAtTachoLimit, SmoothStart)
%
%   NXC_MotorControl(Port, Power, TachoLimit, SpeedRegulation, ActionAtTachoLimit, SmoothStart, handle)
%
% Description
%   The NXC-program "MotorControl" must be running on the brick, otherwise
%   this function will not work. It is used to send advanced motor commands
%   to the NXT that can perform better and more precise motor regulation
%   than possible with only classic direct commands.
%
%   While one command is being executed (i.e. when the motor is still being
%   controlled if a TachoLimit other than 0 was set), this motor cannot
%   accept new commands. Use the NXTMotor classes command .WaitFor to make
%   sure the motor has finished it's current operation, before
%   sending a new one. If the NXC-program receives a new command while it
%   is still busy, a warning signal (high beep, then low beep) will be
%   played.
%
%   The command StopMotor (or NXTMotor's method .Stop) is always available to
%   stop a controlled motor-operation, even before the TachoLimit is reached. 
%
%
% Input:
% * Port has to be a port number between 0 and 2, or an array with max. 2
%   different motors specified.
%
% * Power is the power level applied to the motor, value between -100 and
%   100 (sign changes direction)
%
% * TachoLimit - integer from 0 to 999999, specifies the angle in degrees
%               the motor will try to reach, set 0 to run forever. Note
%               that direction is specified by the sign of Power.
%
% * SpeedRegulation must be false for "normal", unregulated motor
%   control. If set to true, single motors will be operated in speed
%   regulation mode. This means that the motor will increase its internal
%   power setting to reach a constant turning speed. Use this option when
%   working with motors under varying load. If you'd like to have motor movement
%           with preferrably constant torque, it's advisable to disable
%           this option.
%   In conjunction with multiple motors 
%   (i.e. when Port is an array of 2 ports), you have to disable
%   SpeedRegulation! Multiple motorss will enable synchronization between the two
%   motors. They will run at the same speed as if they were connected
%   through and axle, leading to straight movement for driving bots.
%
% * ActionAtTachoLimit is a string parameter with valid options
%   'Coast', 'Brake' or 'HoldBrake'. It specifies how the motor(s) should react
%   when their position counter reaches the set TachoLimit. In COAST
%   mode, the motor(s) will simply be turned of when the TachoLimit is
%   reached, leading to free movement until slowly stopping (called
%   coasting). The TachoLimit won't be met, the motor(s) move way too far
%   (overshooting), depending on their angular momentum.
%   Use BRAKE mode (default) to let the motor(s) automatically
%   slow down nice and smoothly shortly before the TachoLimit. This leads
%   to a very high precision, usually the TachoLimit is met within +/- 1
%   degree (depending on the motor load and speed of course). After this
%   braking, power to the motor(s) is turned off when they are at rest.
%   HOLDBRAKE is similar to BRAKE, but in this case, the active brake of
%   the motors stays enabled (careful, this consumes a lot of battery
%   power), causing the motor(s) to actively keep holding their position.
%
% * SmoothStart can be set to true to smoothly accelerate movement.
%   This "manual ramp up" of power will occur fairly quickly. It's
%   comfortable for driving robots so that they don't loose traction when
%   starting to move. If used in conjunction with SpeedRegulation for
%   single motors, after accleration is finished and the full power is
%   applied, the speed regulation can possibly even accelerate a bit more.
%
% * handle (optional) defines the given NXT connection. If no handle is 
%   specified, the default one (COM_GetDefaultNXT()) is used.
%
%
% Limitations
%
%   If you send a command to the NXT without waiting for the previous motor
%   operation to have finished, the command will be dropped (the NXT
%   indicates this with a high and low beep tone). Use NXTMotor classes WaitFor
%   to make sure the motor is ready for new  commands, or stop the motor
%   using NXTMotor's method .Stop.
%
%   The option SmoothStart in conjunction with ActionAtTachoLimit ==
%   'Coast' is not available. As a workaround, disable SmoothStart for
%   this mode.
%
%   With ActionAtTachoLimit = 'Coast' and synchronous driving (two motors),
%   the motors will stay synced after movement (even after .WaitFor() has
%   finished). This is by design. To disable the synchonization, just use
%   StopMotor(port, 'off').
