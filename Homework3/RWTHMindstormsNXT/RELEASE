RWTH - Mindstorms NXT Toolbox version 4.04 (stable)

    * New features:
          o Support for new sensors:
                + LEGO NXT 2.0 Color (see OpenNXT2Color, GetNXT2Color)
                + HiTechnic Color V2 (see OpenColor, GetColor)
                + HiTechnic EOPD (see OpenEOPD, CalibrateEOPD, GetEOPD)
    * Bugfixes:
          o Fixed a bug (timeout too small) in GetSound that caused data to be 0 for 200ms after opening the sensor
          o Fixed a bug that limited the maximum TachoLimit for NXTMotor to 99999 instead of 999999
    * Improvements / changes:
          o Recommended LEGO firmware is now version 1.28 or better
          o Updated MotorControl to current version 2.2 (recompiled with new compiler for better stability)
          o Added warnings for analog sensor Get-functions in case data do not become valid
          o Increased time out periods in analog sensor Get-functions
          o Toolbox optimization is not necessary anymore since MATLAB Release 2010a (version 7.10 and newer), added version check to OptimizeToolboxPerformance
          o Added some clarifactions to documentation about Bluetooth for serial port devices on Mac OS
          o Minor documentation updates (fixed typos and some broken links)
    * Known bugs and limitations:
          o USB connections on Windows 64bit systems can be problematic, this depends on MATLAB and the Fantom driver. As workaround a 32bit version of MATLAB is recommended.
          o Trying to open USB handles on Linux with no NXT connected but old handles still open can rarely lead to MATLAB crashing. Using COM_CloseNXT prevents this.
          o Mixing methods from the NXTMotor class and the function DirectMotorCommand can lead to warnings or other problems.
          o System functions, especially I/O Map Module functions, do not work with USB-connections in Windows (they do work with Bluetooth on Windows, and with both USB and BT on Linux).

RWTH - Mindstorms NXT Toolbox version 4.01

    * New features:
          o Support for Mac OS (not well tested yet). Requires Mindstorms NXT driver "Fantom" for USB-connections.
          o New motor control (class NXTMotor) from version 4.00 has proven to be stable
          o Updated and included ToolboxBenchmark again
          o New tool ToolboxUpdate checks online for new release (still beta status)
    * Bugfixes:
          o Fixed a condition in NXTMotor which could cause the motor to stall during braking (when moving at low speeds with high load/friction and TachoLimit > 0 and ActionAtTachoLimit == 'Brake' or 'HoldBrake')
          o Disallowed special value 255 for port in DirectMotorCommand (255 for all motors can still be used with NXT_SetOutputState)
          o The ultrasonic sensor can return invalid or wrong values when polled too frequently (i.e. on fast USB connections). A conditional waiting period was introduced to GetUltrasonic, limiting the maximum polling rate to 50 Hz for this sensor.
    * Improvements / changes:
          o Current version of NXC program MotorControl is 2.1 (included with toolbox)
          o Added short waiting periods (max. 100ms) to OpenUltrasonic, OpenAccelerator, OpenCompass, OpenColor, OpenInfrared to allow those digital sensors to power up and boot properly. Should avoid possible bugs (which have not been observed yet anyway).
          o HiTechnic Gyro sensor works more accurate now (added start up delay to OpenGyro, improved calibration in CalibrateGyro, GetGyro returns floats instead of rounded integers now)
          o Internal Bluetooth delay timing accuracy was improved on Windows systems (changed from using etime to tic, toc). Variances in packet transmission delays should be smaller now, overall performance slightly better.
          o Parameter UseThisNXTMAC of COM_OpenNXTEx can now also contain colons, i.e. both '00:16:12:34:56:78' and '001612345678' are valid
          o Removed a possible "flood of warnings" in NXTMotor.WaitFor() if NXC program MotorControl was being terminated during execution
          o NXTMotor display on command line now shows SmoothStart with on / off just as SpeedRegulation (old dispaly was with yes / no)
          o Updated readme / installation guide, provided more batch scripts for compiling and downloading MotorControl to the NXT
          o Added examples in motor documentation
          o Updated documentation in various places
    * Known bugs and limitations:
          o This release has milestone status, so there may be remaining bugs, or documentation might be outdated in some places
          o Tutorials in "Programming Robots", especially about USB connections and motors, are not up-to-date and complete yet.
          o Mixing methods from the NXTMotor class and the function DirectMotorCommand can lead to warnings or other problems.
          o System functions, especially I/O Map Module functions, do not work with USB-connections in Windows (they do work with Bluetooth on Windows, and with both USB and BT on Linux).

    * July 17th, 2009



RWTH - Mindstorms NXT Toolbox version 2.04

    *  New Features:
          o New function NXT_MessageRead (bi-directional communication between NXC programs and MATLAB now supported and successfully tested)
          o New function CalibrateGyro
    * Improvements:
          o Full support for multiple HiTechnic Gyroscopic sensors (even on multiple NXTs), functions OpenGyro and GetGyro updated
          o Minor documentation updates
    * Bugfixes:
          o GetGyro now also checks for validity of sensor data (only applies to prior toolbox version when calling GetGyro straight after OpenGyro via USB on very fast computers)
          o Fixed a minor issue in NXT_StartProgram (corrected parameter check for maximum program name length)
    * Known bugs and limitations:
          o On Linux systems, working with multiple NXTs at a time via several Bluetooth connections can cause problems while opening the NXT handle.
          o The NXTmotor class requires MATLAB 2008a or better.
          o Although the NXTmotor class is designed to work together with the embedded NXC program MotorControl.rxe, a compatibility mode for direct commands is implemented (providing the same functionality as known from the classic motor commands).
          o The method NXC_MotorControl (also affecting NXTmotor's method SendToNXT) contains a forced waiting period of 75 ms both before and after sending the actual command, leading to a total pause of 150 ms when using this method. The time out period will probably be reduced or even removed in future versions.
          o Mixing methods from the NXTmotor class and classic motor commands (such as SetMotor, SendMotorSettings, etc.) can lead to warnings or other problems.
          o Automatic Bluetooth connection establishing works only on Linux and may have certain limitations or cause problems (especially when working with multiple NXTs).
          o System functions, especially I/O Map Module functions, do not work with USB-connections in Windows.
    * April 17th, 2009

    * Improvements:
          o Minor documentation updates
    * Bugfixes:
          o Fixed an issue with very fast computers and USB connections, where retrieving analog sensor data directly after opening those analog sensors could provide invalid values (for a couple of milliseconds). Functions GetLight, GetSound and GetSwitch are fixed now.
          o Fixed a bug where NXT_MessageWrite did not work properly when the NXT default handle was not set.
          o Fixed a bug in both NXC_MotorControl and NXTmotor's method SendToNXT that would cause an error when passing a custom NXT-handle to those functions.
    * Known bugs and limitations:
          o On Linux systems, working with multiple NXTs at a time via several Bluetooth connections can cause problems while opening the NXT handle.
          o Currently, only one HiTechnic Gyro-Sensor is supported globally at a time. Calibration / offset-correction happens implicitly when calling OpenGyro, so the sensor should be at rest at this point.
          o The new NXTmotor class requires MATLAB 2008a or better.
          o Although the NXTmotor class is designed to work together with the new embedded NXC program MotorControl.rxe, a compatibility mode for direct commands is implemented (providing the same functionality as known from the classic motor commands).
          o The method NXC_MotorControl (also affecting NXTmotor's method SendToNXT) contains a forced waiting period of 75 ms both before and after sending the actual command, leading to a total pause of 150 ms when using this method. The time out period will probably be reduced or even removed in future versions.
          o Mixing methods from the NXTmotor class and classic motor commands (such as SetMotor, SendMotorSettings, etc.) can lead to warnings or other problems.
          o The new automatic Bluetooth connection establishing works only on Linux and has not thoroughly been tested yet. Certain sudo-rights might be required.
          o Programs working with toolbox version 1.00 are not working out of the box with version 2.00 or better. The code for opening and closing connections to the NXT brick has to be updated (programs written for version 2.00beta or 2.00 do not have to be modified). See help-section "Guideline for new v2.00 features".
          o System functions, especially I/O Map Module functions, do not work with USB-connections in Windows.
          o Old limitations from version 1.00 regarding hardware compatibility and problems with various Bluetooth adapters still apply.

          o Fixed a condition in NXTmotor's method SendToNXT which now resets error correction every time for every command, no matter which TachoLimit is used.
    * Known bugs and limitations:
          o The new NXTmotor class requires MATLAB 2008a or better.
          o Although the NXTmotor class is designed to work together with the new embedded NXC program MotorControl.rxe, a compatibility mode for direct commands is implemented (providing the same functionality as known from the classic motor commands).
