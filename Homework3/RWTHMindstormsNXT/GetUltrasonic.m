function [DistanceCM] = GetUltrasonic(port, varargin)
% Reads the current value of the NXT ultrasonic sensor
%
% Syntax
%   distance = GetUltrasonic(port)
%
%   distance = GetUltrasonic(port, handle)
%
% Description
%   distance = GetUltraSonic(port) returns the current measurement value distance of the NXT
%   ultrasonic sensor. distance represents the measured distance in cm.
%   If no echo can be detected (which could indicate that either there is
%   no obstacle in the way, or the ultrasound does not get reflected, e.g.
%   by fur-like surfaces), the reading will be 255. If no measurement can
%   be made (defect sensor, cable disconnected, etc.), a value of -1 will
%   be returned.
%
%   The given port number specifies the connection port. The value port can be
%   addressed by the symbolic constants SENSOR_1 , SENSOR_2, SENSOR_3 and SENSOR_4 analog to
%   the labeling on the NXT Brick.
%
%   The last optional argument can be a valid NXT handle. If none is
%   specified, the default handle will be used (call COM_SetDefaultNXT to
%   set one).
%
% Note:
%
%   This function only works when the sensor was correctly opened with
%   OpenUltrasonic(port). If the sensor is being used in snapshot mode,
%   GetUltrasonic will not work correctly!
%
%   For different uses, see also OpenUltrasonic(port, 'snapshot') and the
%   functions USMakeSnapshot and USGetSnapshotResults.
%
% Limitations
%   Since the Ultrasonic sensors all operate at the same frequency,
%   multiple US sensors will interfere with each other! If multiple US
%   sensors can "see each other" (or their echos and reflections),
%   results will be unpredictable (and probably also unusable). You can
%   avoid this problem by turning off US sensors, or operating them in
%   snapshot mode (see also USMakeSnapshot and USGetSnapshotResults).
%
%
% Due to the speed of sound in air, the ultrasonic sensor needs a certain
% amount of time to complete a successful measurement. This is why the
% maximum polling rate has been limited to 50 Hz (i.e. a call will take
% 20ms if called too often). This is only relevant for fast USB
% connections.
%
% Example
%   OpenUltrasonic(SENSOR_4);
%   distance = GetUltrasonic(SENSOR_4);
%   CloseSensor(SENSOR_4);
