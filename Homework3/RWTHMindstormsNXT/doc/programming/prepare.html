%% Preparing the workspace
% Before you develop a new robot control application you should make sure that all NXT handles,
% global variables and settings are resetted and the old figures are closed.
% To make sure you are working with a clean workspace use: 

COM_CloseNXT('all')
close all
clear all

%%
% at the beginning of your main robot application. The important thing here
% is that |clear all| comes _after_ |COM_CloseNXT|, otherwise it won't work.

%%
% If you also want a clean
% command window (which helps cleaning previous error messages when
% tracking bugs), you can optionally use

clc % clear old messages from command line

%%
% This leavey your command history fully untouched by the way.
% Now you should have a clean environment for your program.
