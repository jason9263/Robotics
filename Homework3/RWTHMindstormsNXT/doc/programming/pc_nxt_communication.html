%% Introduction
% All examples here assume you correctly
% setup MATLAB, the toolbox, and installed the correct drivers 
% (Fantom or libusb, depending on your OS) as documented in the
% installation guide.
% 

%%
% As mentioned in the previous chapter "Preparing the workspace", you
% always have to create a clean environment for your program. So never
% forget to call

COM_CloseNXT all

%%
% at the beginning of each program (followed by |close all| and |clear
% all| if you like), it really makes things easier. But enough about
% closing handles, how do we open them? There are two functions:
%
% * |COM_OpenNXT| - this is the easiest and most convenient way and will be

% * |COM_OpenNXTEx| - this advanced version gives you more control and
% takes more parameters. You can specify which NXT you exactly want to
% connect you. You'll usually need this for multi-NXT applications.
%

%% Quick start
% We first focus on USB connections. This is the easiest and fastest way to
% connect an NXT to a computer. 

hNXT = COM_OpenNXT(); % look for USB devices
NXT_PlayTone(440, 500, hNXT);

%%
% That's it! The variable / struct |hNXT| is the handle describing the
% device we talked about. In the mini example above, a tone is played right

% The best way to go with normal NXT programs is to set the default NXT
% device. By doing so you can stop passing the NXT handle to every

% programs:

COM_CloseNXT all
hNXT = COM_OpenNXT();       % look for USB devices
COM_SetDefaultNXT(hNXT);    % sets global default handle

% now we don't have to use hNXT anymore!
NXT_PlayTone(440, 500);
pause(0.5);
NXT_PlayTone(440, 500);

% but never forget to clean up after your work!!!
COM_CloseNXT(hNXT);

%%
% As you can see, we also have to clean up at the end of a program and
% close all handles we opened. If your program crashes and the end with the
% clean up is never reached, well: that's bad luck. That is why we have the
% |COM_CloseNXT all| at the beginning of each program to absolutely make
% sure all handles are closed. Still: Better be safe than sorry. Forgetting
% to close handles can lead to memory leaks or MATLAB crashes.

%%
% One thing left to note: |COM_CloseNXT()| will always take the first NXT
% device on the USB bus it finds. That is why it's not really useful for
% multi-NXT applications.

%% Easy Bluetooth
% We've covered USB connections now. If we want to connect wireless to our

%

%%
% So let's try it!

COM_CloseNXT all
hNXT = COM_OpenNXT('bluetooth.ini');  % look for USB devices, THEN for Bluetooth
COM_SetDefaultNXT(hNXT);              % set global default handle

NXT_PlayTone(440, 500);

% clean up
COM_CloseNXT(hNXT);


%%
% As you can see, the only difference is passing the |'bluetooth.ini'|
% parameter. In this case, |bluetooth.ini| has to be a valid BT config file

%% Using multiple NXTs
% When using more than one NXT in your programs, |COM_OpenNXT| is not so
% useful. You should have a look at the documentation of |COM_OpenNXTEx|
% instead. There you can specify whether you explicitely want to look for

% the different devices, and MATLAB always knows which NXT you mean).

%%
% This is enough for starters, if you're interested in more details about
% Bluetooth connections and how the toolbox internally works, read on.
% Otherwise you can skip to the next chapter.


%% Understanding Bluetooth connections
% To communicate with the NXT via bluetooth, we have to use the SPP (serial
% port profile), which basically works like a virtual serial port. This is
% why we can send and receive data from within MATLAB through the serial
% port commands.
%
% To handle different connections or bluetooth adapters on different
% computers easily, a certain ini-file with settings for the MATLAB functions must be
% present in the current directory (or one that can be found through path settings).
%
% The ini-file format looks like this
%%
%  [Bluetooth]
%  
%  SerialPort=COM3
%  BaudRate=57600
%  DataBits=8
%  
%  SendSendPause=10
%  SendReceivePause=30
%  
%  TimeOut=2
%
% Most important is |SerialPort|. Again, the actual value depends on your
% hardware configuration. On Windows it'll probably be a COM-port, on Linux
% and Mac systems it's a serial device such as |/dev/tty.WL1-DevB| or
% |/dev/rfcomm0|.
% The other serial settings should be self explaining, default values are ok. Explanation of the
% send-pause-values will follow later on. The |TimeOut| parameter only has
% an effect when using Windows. It sets the period the bluetooth stack
% should wait when it is "missing data". The MATLAB-internal default value
% of 10 causes annoying freezes in certain robot programs on certain
% computers (a direct cause is not yet found). By setting 2 (the toolbox default
% value), one should get a fairly stable experience with very rare execution pauses of 2 
% seconds. Smaller timeout values can lead to real packet loss which has
% not been examined yet. More information on this can also be read in the
% section "Troubleshooting" of the toolbox help.
%
% To create a bluetooth configuration ini-file, a standard editor can be used.
% A more comfortable way is to use the GUI-guided program:
COM_MakeBTConfigFile;

%%
% The following functions work under Windows as well as Linux and Mac OS.
% The returned structure (referred to as "handle" in the future) contains
% many information and function pointers. There is no need to use them. If
% you do, your program can easily crash
%
% Now first have a look how to obtain a handle to a bluetooth connection.

% Before we open a handle, we clean up to avoid errors:
COM_CloseNXT('all', 'bluetooth.ini');

% This only closes all open serial ports matching the COM-port from the
% ini-file. More drastical is to close all open COM-ports and USB-handles like this:
COM_CloseNXT('all');

%%
% Now we can open a connection. Make sure the bluetooth dongle is connected
% to the NXT brick (using the according software or scripts) before calling
% this. Using this syntax, MATLAB will actually look for a USB connection
% first, and only go on to connect via Bluetooth if there is no USB device
% present.
h = COM_OpenNXT('bluetooth.ini');
%%
% The function sends a keep-alive-packet and waits for the answer before returning a valid
% handle. This is very comfortable as it detects a malfunctioning / closed
% bluetooth connection before the execution of other program code.

%%
% Set the global default handle, so that later on, whenever we're calling
% functions, we don't have to pass the handle every time.
COM_SetDefaultNXT(h);

% This is self-explanatory
handle = COM_GetDefaultNXT;

%%
% To close an open connection / handle, just call
COM_CloseNXT(h);

% although this would also do the trick:
COM_CloseNXT('all');


%% Sending and receiving data
% This section is mainly about the way the toolbox sends data to the NXT or
% how it retrieves them. There is no need for normal users to read this
% section. It's only interesting for developers. We have:
%%
% * |COM_CreatePacket|
% * |COM_SendPacket|
% * |COM_CollectPacket|
%%
% These functions are very "low level" and you should usually not use them
% on your own, unless you're implementing new NXT functions. All the
% already implemented NXT functions make use of these.

%%
% First we've got
packet = COM_CreatePacket(CommandType, Command, ReplyMode, ContentBytes);

%%
% where ReplyMode either has to be 'reply' or 'dontreply', specifying
% wether we want an answer from the NXT or not. This command essentially
% creates the binary data for a packet, taking care of payload size and
% similar things.
% For more details see inside the "Bluetooth Engine Demo" file.

%%
% Now it's getting interesting. We've got two functions to send and receive
% data respectively. Because the LEGO NXT brick has a 30ms latency when
% switching from transmit to receive mode, we can expect a 60ms latency for
% a whole sensor reading request.
%
% Very important is that the NXT can apparently lose packets / commands,
% because the input buffer (or queue) is of limited size. As we do not know
% any more details about this, the send and receive functions have the option to

% In this case we demand a 10ms delay between two consecutive send

% and receive operation (and vice versa receive and send). This should give
% the NXT enough time so switch between bluetooth transmission modes
% without loosing any packets.
%
% Note: The functions are "intelligent" and only pause execution if it is
% necessary. So if you only try to send a packet once every second, you
% will not notice this automatic delay, as it is not required.

% for this function, we always have to specify a valid serial port handle
COM_SendPacket(packet, handle);

%%
% Receiving packets is as easy. Make sure you have requested one before you
% try to collect something.
[type cmd statusbyte content] = COM_CollectPacket(handle);

%%
% The statusbyte will be checked automatically by this function, and if it
% contains an error message, an according warning will be issued. You can 
% disable the automatic status byte check by calling
% |COM_CollectPacket(handle, 'dontcheck')|. There is really just one special
% situation where this is needed: |NXT_LSGetStatus| (see documentation and function
% code). To manually inspect the statusbyte, you can have a look at the
% function |checkStatusByte|.
%
% |COM_CollectPacket| exactly retrieves one packet from the internal receive buffer.
% It does so by checking the length of the packet (first two bytes) and
% then only reads the amount of data that belongs to this specific packet.
% Be very careful though: If you call it without previously requesting
