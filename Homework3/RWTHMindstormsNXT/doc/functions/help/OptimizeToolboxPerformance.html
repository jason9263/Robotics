%% Description
%%
% This script automates toolbox optimization. The private functions
% wordbytes2dec and dec2wordbytes are very frequently called and thus most
% critical for performance (mostly, but not only CPU load), especially at
% high packet rates (USB). Profiling shows the bottleneck: typecast.
% When using the binary version from the MATLAB directory, speed-ups up to
% 300% can be experienced. However this binary version is in a private
% directory, so cannot be called directly. Also it depends on the OS, CPU
% architecture and MATLAB version used. So, the only solution: We copy
% those binary files to our own toolboxes private directory.
%%
% The script asks the user for permission and performs the file actions
% automatically. After each step the results will be checked to avoid a
% corrupt toolbox.
%%
% During the process, the m-files for the above named functions will be
% overwritten. This is the reason we provide 2 versions in the private dir,
% .m.slow (the original with typecast) and .m.fast (optimized version that
% needs binary typecastc files in the same directory).
%%
% Note: The optimization is not possible anymore since MATLAB Release 2010a
% (i.e. since MATLAB version 7.10 and greater). As |typecast| is now a
% built-in function, optimization is probably not necessary anymore anyway.
