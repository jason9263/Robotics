%% Description
% To help you make sense of the HiTechnic EOPD sensor values, this
% function can calibrate the sensor. The method is based on this article:
% http://www.hitechnic.com/blog/eopd-sensor/eopd-how-to-measure-distance/#more-178
%%
% Before your start calibration, open the sensor using |OpenEOPD| and a
% mode of your choice. Please note: The calibration will be valid for
% this mode only. So if you choose long range mode during calibration,
% you must use this mode all the time when working with this specific
% calibration setting.
%%
% The calibration process is straight forward. You place the sensor at a
% known distance in front of a surface. First you need to chose a short
% distance, e.g. around 3cm (not too close). Then you call this function with
% |calibrationMode = 'NEAR'|, followed by |nearDist| set to the actual
% distance. This can be centimeters, millimeters, or LEGO studs. The unit
% doesn't matter as long as you keep it consistend. The value later
% returned by |GetEOPD| will be in this exact units.
%%
% As second step, you have to place the sensor at another known distance,
% preferrably at the end of the range. Let's just say we use 9cm this
% time. Now call this functions with |calibrationMode = 'FAR'|, followed
% by a 9. That's it. The sensor is now calibrated.
%%
% Before you continue to use the sensor, you should retrieve the
% calibration matrix and store it for later use. This matrix is
% essentialy just a combination of the two distances you used for
% calibration, and the according EOPD raw sensor readings. Out of these
% two data pairs, the distance mapping is calculated, which is used inside
% |GetEOPD|. To retrieve the matrix, call |calibMatrix =
% CalibrateEOPD(port, 'READMATRIX')|.
%%
% If later on you want to leave out the calibration of a specific EOPD
% sensor for certain environmental conditions, you can simply re-use the
% calibration matrix. Call |CalibrateEOPD(port, 'SETMATRIX',
% calibMatrix)|. The format of the 2x2 calibMatrix is:
% |[nearDist nearEOPD; farDist farEOPD]|.
%%
% To summarize:
%%
% # Use the |'NEAR'| mode with a short distance to the surface.
% # Use the |'FAR'| mode with a long distance to the surface (all
% relatively. The order can be swapped).
% # Retrieve and store the calibration matrix using the |'READMATRIX'|
% mode.
% # Later on, if you want to skip steps 1 - 3, just directly load the matrix
% from step 3 using the |'SETMATRIX'| mode.

%% Limitations
% Calibration is stored inside the NXT handle, for a specific port. This
% means after closing the NXT handle, or when connecting the sensor to
% another port, calibration is lost. That is why you should either always
% run the calibration at the begin of your program, or restore the
% previous state with the |'SETMATRIX'| calibration mode.
%%
% Unlike most other functions, this one cannot be called with an NXT
% handle as last argument. Please use |COM_SetDefaultNXT| before.

%% Examples
   port = SENSOR_2;
   OpenEOPD(port, 'SHORT');

   % place sensor to 3cm distance, you can also try 2cm or similar
   CalibrateEOPD(port, 'NEAR', 3);
   pause;

   % place sensor to 9cm distance, you can also try 10cm or similar
   CalibrateEOPD(port, 'FAR', 9);

   % retrieve & display calibration matrix
   calibMatrix = CalibrateEOPD(port, 'READMATRIX');
   disp(calibMatrix);

   % now the sensor can be used
   [dist raw] = GetEOPD(port);

   % clean up, as usual. LED stays on anyway
   CloseSensor(port);
%%
   % Later on in another program, you can
   % restore the calibration:
   OpenEOPD(port, 'SHORT'); % use same mode as for calibration

   % manually set calibMatrix or load from file

   % now restore calibration
   CalibrateEOPD(port, 'SETMATRIX', calibMatrix);

   % sensor ready to be used now...
