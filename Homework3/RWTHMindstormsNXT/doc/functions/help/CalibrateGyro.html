%% CalibrateGyro
% Calibrates the HiTechnic Gyro sensor (measures/sets an offset while in rest)
%%
%% Syntax
% |offset = CalibrateGyro(port, 'AUTO')|
%%
% |offset = CalibrateGyro(port, 'AUTO', handle)|
%%
% |offset = CalibrateGyro(port, 'MANUAL', manualOffset)|
%%
% |offset = CalibrateGyro(port, 'MANUAL', manualOffset, handle)|
%%
%% Description
% In order to use the HiTechnic Gyro Sensor, it has first to be opened
% using |OpenGyro|. Then |CalibrateGyro| should be called (or a warning
% will be issued). Only after this you can safely use |GetGyro| to
% retrieve values.
%%
% This function will set (and return) the new offset (i.e. reading during
% rest) of the according Gyro sensor. Normally users should use the
%%
% *automatic* calibration mode: |offset = CalibrateGyro(port, 'AUTO')|
%%
% The offset will be calculated automatically. During this function the Gyro sensor
% value will be measured for at least 1 second (or for at least 5 times). During this
% period, the sensor must be at full rest!
%%
% If you want to save time during your program with a well-known Gyro
% sensor, or you cannot assure that the sensor is at rest during
% calibration, you can use the automatic calibration once in the command
% line and remember the determined offset value. Using manual
% calibration, you can then set a hardcoded value manually (saving you
% time and the calibration for this sensor in the future in that specific
% program).
%%
% Use |CalibrateGyro(port, 'MANUAL', manualOffset)| to achieve this, with
% a correct offset obtained from automatic calibration. This call won't
% require that the sensor doesn't move. Also the call is very fast (as
% compared to at least 1 second in automatic mode). Use integers for
% |manualOffset|, as the gyro sensor is only accurate to +/- 1 degree per
% second anyway.
%%
% The last optional argument (for both modes) can be a valid NXT handle. If none is
% specified, the default handle will be used (call |COM_SetDefaultNXT| to
% set one).
%%
%%
% *Note:*
%%
% Manual calibration only works for one specific sensor (i.e. one unique
% piece of hardware). Other sensors might have different offsets. Also it
% could be possible that the offset changes over time or is dependent on
% your working environment (humidity, temperature, etc).
%%
%% Limitations
% Calibration is stored inside the NXT handle, for a specific port. This
% means after closing the NXT handle, or when connecting the sensor to
% another port, calibration is lost. That is why you should either always
% run the calibration at the begin of your program, or restore the
% previous offset with the |'MANUAL'| calibration mode.
%%
%% Examples
   % in this example the gyro is used with automatic
   % calibration, very straight forward

   port = SENSOR_2;
   OpenGyro(port);
   CalibrateGyro(port, 'AUTO');

   % now the gyro is ready to be used!
   % do something, main program etc...
   speed = GetGyro(port);

   % do something else, loop etc...
   % don't forget to clean up
   CloseSensor(port);
%%
   % in this example we save the time and effort of
   % automatic calibration each time the main program is run...
   % on a command window, type:
   h = COM_OpenNXT();
   COM_SetDefaulNXT(h);
   OpenGyro(SENSOR_1);
   % now, once the automatic calibration:
   offset = CalibrateGyro(SENSOR_1, 'AUTO');
   % remember this value...
%%
   % our main program looks like this:
   % always open gyro first:
   OpenGyro(SENSOR_1);
   % now use the offset value determined earlier:
   CalibrateGyro(SENSOR_1, 'MANUAL', offset);
   % ready to use GetGyro now...
