%% NXC_MotorControl
% Sends advanced motor-command to the NXC-program MotorControl on the NXT brick
%%
%% Syntax
% |NXC_MotorControl(Port, Power, TachoLimit, SpeedRegulation, ActionAtTachoLimit, SmoothStart)|
%%
% |NXC_MotorControl(Port, Power, TachoLimit, SpeedRegulation, ActionAtTachoLimit, SmoothStart, handle)|
%%
%% Description
% The NXC-program "MotorControl" must be running on the brick, otherwise
% this function will not work. It is used to send advanced motor commands
% to the NXT that can perform better and more precise motor regulation
% than possible with only classic direct commands.
%%
% While one command is being executed (i.e. when the motor is still being
% controlled if a |TachoLimit| other than 0 was set), this motor cannot
% accept new commands. Use the NXTMotor classes command |.WaitFor| to make
% sure the motor has finished it's current operation, before
% sending a new one. If the NXC-program receives a new command while it
% is still busy, a warning signal (high beep, then low beep) will be
% played.
%%
% The command |StopMotor| (or NXTMotor's method |.Stop|) is always available to
% stop a controlled motor-operation, even before the |TachoLimit| is reached.
%%
%%
%%
% *Input:*
%%
% * |Port| has to be a port number between 0 and 2, or an array with max. 2
% different motors specified.
%%
%%
% * |Power| is the power level applied to the motor, value between -100 and
% 100 (sign changes direction)
%%
%%
% * |TachoLimit| - integer from 0 to 999999, specifies the angle in degrees
% the motor will try to reach, set 0 to run forever. Note
% that direction is specified by the sign of |Power|.
%%
%%
% * |SpeedRegulation| must be |false| for "normal", unregulated motor
% control. If set to |true|, single motors will be operated in speed
% regulation mode. This means that the motor will increase its internal
% power setting to reach a constant turning speed. Use this option when
% working with motors under varying load. If you'd like to have motor movement
% with preferrably constant torque, it's advisable to disable
% this option.
% In conjunction with multiple motors
% (i.e. when |Port| is an array of 2 ports), you have to disable
% |SpeedRegulation|! Multiple motorss will enable synchronization between the two
% motors. They will run at the same speed as if they were connected
% through and axle, leading to straight movement for driving bots.
%%
%%
% * |ActionAtTachoLimit| is a string parameter with valid options
% |'Coast'|, |'Brake'| or |'HoldBrake'|. It specifies how the motor(s) should react
% when their position counter reaches the set |TachoLimit|. In COAST
% mode, the motor(s) will simply be turned of when the |TachoLimit| is
% reached, leading to free movement until slowly stopping (called
% coasting). The |TachoLimit| won't be met, the motor(s) move way too far
% (overshooting), depending on their angular momentum.
% Use BRAKE mode (default) to let the motor(s) automatically
% slow down nice and smoothly shortly before the |TachoLimit|. This leads
% to a very high precision, usually the |TachoLimit| is met within +/- 1
% degree (depending on the motor load and speed of course). After this
% braking, power to the motor(s) is turned off when they are at rest.
% HOLDBRAKE is similar to BRAKE, but in this case, the active brake of
% the motors stays enabled (careful, this consumes a lot of battery
% power), causing the motor(s) to actively keep holding their position.
%%
%%
% * |SmoothStart| can be set to |true| to smoothly accelerate movement.
% This "manual ramp up" of power will occur fairly quickly. It's
% comfortable for driving robots so that they don't loose traction when
% starting to move. If used in conjunction with |SpeedRegulation| for
% single motors, after accleration is finished and the full power is
% applied, the speed regulation can possibly even accelerate a bit more.
%%
%%
% * |handle| (optional) defines the given NXT connection. If no handle is
% specified, the default one (|COM_GetDefaultNXT()|) is used.
%%
%%
%% Limitations
%%
% If you send a command to the NXT without waiting for the previous motor
% operation to have finished, the command will be dropped (the NXT
% indicates this with a high and low beep tone). Use NXTMotor classes |WaitFor|
% to make sure the motor is ready for new  commands, or stop the motor
% using NXTMotor's method |.Stop|.
%%
% The option |SmoothStart| in conjunction with |ActionAtTachoLimit ==
% 'Coast'| is not available. As a workaround, disable |SmoothStart| for
% this mode.
%%
% With |ActionAtTachoLimit = 'Coast'| and synchronous driving (two motors),
% the motors will stay synced after movement (even after |.WaitFor()| has
% finished). This is by design. To disable the synchonization, just use
% |StopMotor(port, 'off')|.
