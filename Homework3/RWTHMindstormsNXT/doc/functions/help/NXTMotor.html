% When using a motor object with two ports set, the motors will be

% NXT firmware tries to move both motors at the same speed and to the
% same position (so that driving robots can go a straight line for example). With |ActionAtTachoLimit == 'Coast'| the sync mode will stay

%%
%%
%% Limitations
% If you send a command to the NXT without waiting for the previous motor
% operation to have finished, the command will be dropped (the NXT
% indicates this with a high and low beep tone). Use the classes method |WaitFor|
% to make sure the motor is ready for new  commands, or stop the motor
% using the method |.Stop|.
%%
% The option |SmoothStart| in conjunction with |ActionAtTachoLimit ==
% 'Coast'| is not available. As a workaround, disable |SmoothStart| for
% this mode. |SmoothStart| will generally only work when |TachoLimit| > 0
% is set.
%%
% With ActionAtTachoLimit = 'Coast' and synchronous driving (two motors),
% the motors will stay synced after movement (even after |.WaitFor()| has
% finished). This is by design. To disable the synchonization, just use
% |.Stop('off')|.
%%
%%
% |SpeedRegulation = true| does not always produce the expected result.
% Due to internal PID regulation, the actually achieved speed can vary or
% oscillate when using very small values for |Power|. This happens
% especially when using the motor with a heavy load for small speeds. In
% this case it can be better to disable |SpeedRegulation|. In general,
% speed regulation should only be enabled if a constant rotational
% velocity is desired. For constant torque, better disable this feature.

      % Construct a NXTMotor object on port 'B' with a power of
      % 60, disabled speed regulation, a TachoLimit of 360 and
      % send the motor settings to the NXT brick.
