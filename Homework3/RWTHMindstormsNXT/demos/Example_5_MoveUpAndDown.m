%% Example 5: Move up and down
% Make a motor precisely move back and forth 10 times
%
% Example which moves a motor (or robotic arm) 10 times back and
% forth (up and down), as precisely as possible without blindly trusting
% the motor commands. Very simple error compensation (i.e. trying absolute
% movements instead of always relative).

% Now let's imagine we want to control a robotic arm. For the sake of this
% example, we want it to move up and down, alternatingly for 10 times. Let
% the arm just have one joint, so we only control one motor. A little
% problem is gravity: The arm has a certain weight. So if we aren't
% careful, moving it downwards will sometimes result in a little lower
% position than we expect, and moving upwards won't move the motor as far
% as we hope all the time. After all, the motor control is only accurate to
% a couple of degrees (+/- 1 most of the time, but not necessarily equally
% distributed). So without reading the motor's position and accounting for
% those inaccuracies, the errors would accumulate over time and cause a
% significant displacement of the arm. By simply retrieving the arm's
% position and making sure that it moves a bit more upwards if necessary,
% or a bit less downwards, we can avoid the accumulating errors and have
% precise movement even after a long period of operation. Here is how its
% done:

% verify that the RWTH - Mindstorms NXT toolbox is installed.
if verLessThan('RWTHMindstormsNXT', '4.01');
    error('This program requires the RWTH - Mindstorms NXT Toolbox version 4.01 or greater. Go to http://www.mindstorms.rwth-aachen.de and follow the installation instructions!');
